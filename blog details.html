        <p style="font-size: 30px;">Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Wednesday secured the vote of confidence in the
          House of Representatives.

          Dahal received 157 votes in the 275-member parliament. A total of 110 lawmakers voted against while a member
          abstained.

          A total of 268 lawmakers were present in todayâ€™s meeting. The prime minister required at least 138 votes to
          win the trust motion. <br> <br>

          The prime minister sought a vote of confidence as the Nepali Congress withdrew its support to the government
          after he broke the alliance with Congress and joined hands with the CPN-UML and other parties on March 4.

          This is the third time he secured a vote of trust in the parliament after he became prime minister in December
          2022 with the support of the CPN-UML, among other parties.

          Dahal had gone for the floor test for the first time on January 10, 2023. He had received 268 votes then.

          The Prime Minister had to take the floor test for the second time only three months later after he again broke
          ties with the CPN-UML and forged an alliance with Congress in March.

          He had received 172 votes at the time. <br> <br>

          "Of 268 lawmakers who took part in the voting, 157 voted for the vote of confidence, which is a majority of
          the total existing lawmakers in the house," said Dev Raj Ghimire, speaker of the lower house. "Prime Minister
          Pushpa Kamal Dahal has won the vote of confidence."

          The support of 138 lawmakers is enough to win the vote of trust in the 275-member chamber.

          The vote of confidence became mandatory after Dahal broke alliance with the Nepali Congress, the largest party
          in the lower house, and reintroduced the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) into the new
          coalition on March 4 and formed a 22-member new cabinet days later.

          This was the third time for Dahal, chairman of CPN (Maoist Center), to win a vote of trust since he became the
          head of a coalition government comprising the CPN-UML in late December 2022 following the general election in
          November that year.
